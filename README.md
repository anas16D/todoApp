# todoApp
A website to manage daily or weekly todo tasks.


You can add or delete tasks in the lists.
Tasks will be in the list on page refereh or even tabs closed.

app1.js is the updated file while app.js is the old one, althogh there are very few differences.
Main difference between the two is how data is stored in local storage.

There is no server side scripting. Only client side javascript is used.
